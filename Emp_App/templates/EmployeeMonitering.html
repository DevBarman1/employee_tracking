                There are cons to everything, even a genie can only grant three
                wishes. Let us address some possible cons of Employee monitoring
                and know how we can easily tackle them:
              </p>

              <span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 18px"
                >Privacy concerns</span
              >
              <p>
                The first thing that concerns most employees and employers is
                the potential privacy breach. Privacy is an issue when activity
                is monitored. People use work computers for personal and work
                reasons and want their activities to remain secret. Also, the
                concept of someone "monitoring their every action" is
                unappealing to many people. It's spooky! Assure your staff that
                their privacy is extremely important. You're not looking at
                them; you're analyzing data. Personal information such as
                passwords, driver's licenses, passports, and other security
                numbers aren't of interest to you. This can also be addressed by
                limiting the use of the software to company devices.

                Is Employee Surveillance Legal?
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a number of myths concerning the legality of data
                collection that may put you off. Is it even lawful to monitor
                employees?
              </p>
              <p>
                In a word, yeah. Workplace regulations indicate that your
                employer can monitor you online. This implies they can read your
                emails on their server, for example. The sole limitation at the
                moment is that phone calls are not permitted. It is illegal for
                an employer to listen in on an employee's personal phone calls
                unless the employee is aware of the situation and gives his or
                her approval. If the employee is utilizing company-owned
                equipment, they don't require approval for any additional
                activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                We recommend routinely alerting your staff you plan to install
                the software and explaining how it will be utilized for the
                greatest outcomes and to establish a culture of trust. They'll
                be aware of the categories of data collected when it was
                collected, and why it was collected. The more transparent you
                are, the less likely you are to get into legal problems.
